			<h3>Dataset Description</h3>
      <p>
				The Star Wars Survey dataset is a labeled dataset with 1188 records.

				opinions on the Star Wars franchise and some personal information
				such as:

				<li>"Which is your favorite movie?",</li>
				<li>"Which character shot first?",</li>
				<li>"Gender",</li>
				<li>"Income",</li>

			<h3>Project Description</h3>
      <p>
        Our aim is to train a classifier to predict a person's answers to
				some questions about the franchise given their answers to other such
				questions, or to try to predict a person's personal characteristics
				based off of their answers to questions about the franchise.
      </p>
