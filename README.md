## Project Description
Given a Star Wars Survey dataset, our aim is to train a classifier to predict a person's answers to some questions about the franchise given their answers to other such questions, or to try to predict a person's personal characteristics based off of their answers to questions about the franchise.

## Dataset Description
The Star Wars Survey dataset is a labeled dataset with 1188 records. It has 15 features, which are survey questions regarding people's opinions on the Star Wars franchise and some personal information such as:

* "Do you consider yourself a Star Wars fan?",
* "Which is your favorite movie?",
* "Which character shot first?",
* "Gender",
* "Income",
* et cetera.

More information about the dataset can be found [here.](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey)

## Project Notebooks
The project is divided into the six Jupyter Notebooks below:

1. [Data Preparation](./data_prep.ipynb)
2. [Data Exploration and Feature Engineering](./data_expl_feature_eng.ipynb)
3. [Decision Tree Classifier](./decision_trees.ipynb)
4. [K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier](./knn.ipynb)
5. [Naive Bayes Classifier](./naive_bayes.ipynb)
6. [Neural Networks Classifier](./neural_network.ipynb)

## Miscellaneous Files
* [Column Names](./column_names.txt) - Text file manually created and used in the Data Preparation notebook to replace the two header rows of the dataset with a simpler, single header row.
* [Unique Values](./unique_values.txt) - Text file generated in the Data Preparation notebook in order to manually check for inconsistent values in the dataset.

## Repository Information
* There are two copies of each Jupyter Notebook: an html version and an ipynb
version.
* There are three versions of the dataset: 'survey_raw' is the initial version
of the dataset, 'survey_data' is the cleaned version of the dataset resulting
from the Data Preparation stage of the project, and 'survey_numeric' is the
numeric version of the dataset resulting from the Feature Engineering stage of
the project.
