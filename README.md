## Dataset Description 
The Star Wars Survey dataset is a labeled dataset with 1188 records. It has 15 features, which are survey questions regarding people's opinions on the Star Wars franchise and some personal information such as: 

* "Do you consider yourself a Star Wars fan?",
* "Which is your favorite movie?",
* "Which character shot first?",
* "Gender",
* "Income",
* et cetera. 

More information about the dataset can be found [here.](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey) 

## Project Description 
Our aim is to train a classifier to predict a person's answers to some questions about the franchise given their answers to other such questions, or to try to predict a person's personal characteristics based off of their answers to questions about the franchise. 

## Project Notebooks 
The project is divided into the six Jupyter Notebooks below: 

1. [Data Preparation](./project_files/data_prep.ipynb)
2. [Data Exploration and Feature Engineering](./project_files/data_expl_feature_eng.ipynb)
3. [Decision Tree Classifier](./project_files/decision_trees.ipynb)
4. [K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier](./project_files/knn.ipynb)
5. [Naive Bayes Classifier](./project_files/naive_bayes.ipynb)
6. [Neural Networks Classifier](./project_files/neural_network.ipynb) 

## Miscellaneous Files 
* [Column Names](./project_files/column_names.txt) - Text file manually created and used in the Data Preparation notebook to replace the two header rows of the dataset with a simpler, single header row. 
* [Unique Values](./project_files/unique_values.txt) - Text file generated in the Data Preparation notebook in order to manually check for inconsistent values in the dataset. 

## Repository Information 
* All HTML files in root folder are for web hosting the project, and were not utilized in the project itself. 
* The 'project_files' folder includes all files necessary for running the notebooks, which includes the dataset files and the Column Names text file, and all outputs of the notebooks, which includes the cleaned dataset files and the Unique Values text file.
