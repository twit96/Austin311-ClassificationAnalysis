<h1 align="center"> Star Wars Survey Classification Analysis </h1> <br>

* The Star Wars Survey dataset is a labeled dataset with 1188 records. It has 15 features, which are survey questions regarding people's opinions on the Star Wars franchise and some personal information such as: "Do you consider yourself a Star Wars fan?", "Which is your favorite movie?", "Which character shot first?", "Gender", "Income", et cetera.
* More information about the dataset can be found [here.](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey) 

* Our aim is to train a classifier to predict a person's answers to some questions about the franchise given their answers to other such questions, or to try to predict a person's personal characteristics based off of their answers to questions about the franchise.

* The notebooks are numbered based off of the order they should be viewed in.
